You pick up a book you've been trying to read for the past few weeks.

You spend the next hour or so reading, and feel calmer.

You are tired.

2. [[Go to sleep for the night uninvited]]
3. [[Golden ending]] - if you do lecture -> lunch -> ready meal -> favourite shows -> truth mum call -> workshop -> read a book
