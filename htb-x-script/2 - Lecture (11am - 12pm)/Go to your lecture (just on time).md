The walk to university is short, and you get to the entrance of your lecture hall just as class is about to start.

You notice Jordan is sitting in an empty row near the front of the lecture theatre. He hasn't noticed you come in.

You think if you try to sit with him you might still be standing when the lecturer starts talking.

1. ~~Go and sit with Jordan~~
2. ~~Sit with others~~
3. [[Sit alone at the back of the theatre]]
